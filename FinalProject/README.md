# SING!

## Update: May 7
For our final project, we had to create anything on Processing. After discovering this amazing [website](http://david.li/) by David Li, I decided to re-create his Choir example.

The sample [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_pv9aQdcJg) does not have the sound yet, but if you run the [code](/FinalProject/may5.pde), you can see that each starting note plays a chord of 3 notes.

Current features are:

1. mouseX determines the volume
2. mouseY determines:
    - the chord being played
    - the size of mouth image
    - the red box and text displayed

Future steps that I see are:
1. Make the background more interactive and fun (perhaps using Pixels)
2. Add a "direction" feature so that scale up sounds different from scale down based on music theory
3. Do some research on math behind scale to add some interactive element that can determine the key (starting Do)
