## Party Portrait!

<img src="setup.png" alt="top" width="250" height="250">

For this week's assignment, we were asked to create a self-portrait using Processing. Instead of just creating some shapes that resemble my face, I decided to make it a little fun and add an interactive feature called Party Screen.

Essentially, the setup is a grey background with my self-portrait displaying normally, and there is a simple text instruction that says "Click to start the party". Once the user does, then the screen changes colors repeatedly. When the user types in 'party' to celebrate, different facial features mapped to each character will be displayed on the screen (a little creepy, no?) Examples are shown below:

<img src="party1.png" alt="top" width="250" height="250">

<img src="party2.png" alt="top" width="250" height="250">

<img src="party3.png" alt="top" width="250" height="250">

Once their eyes are tired of the color stimulation, they can click again, and the screen is back to the original setup - a grey background and my entire face.
